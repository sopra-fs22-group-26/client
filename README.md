# ScrumbleBee :bee:
## Introduction
The idea of our project ScrumbleBee is to create an online task management system which encourages its users to complete their tasks by including gamification elements. In addition to the basic capabilities, like assigning users, due dates and comments to tasks, the members of ScrumbleBee can award points to each other for having successfully completed tasks. As this platform could also be used in a Scrum environment, we include an	 “Estimate Poll” widget, where the members can estimate the time needed to complete a task in real-time. By considering information from external sources like travel time to a location or dates of public holidays, time collisions should belong to the past, and a calendar export function allows the product to be integrated in your daily workflow.

## Technologies

- React: CSS, JavaScript, HTML
- GitHub (Actions)
- Heroku
- REST API

## High-Level Components

- Task
- User
- Estimate Poll Session


## Launch & Deployment

how to deply the system

## Demo

_TODO: INSERT SCREENSHOTS AND GIFs ONCE DEPLOYMENT IS FINISHED_

## Roadmap
Potential improvements or extensions in the future may include:

- Implement a group feature, such that users are able to create and join subgroups. E.g. a user is part of a work group and part of a family group.

- something more

## Prerequisites and Installation
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome).

### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
